# Solution to Zocket Problem 1
This is my attempt to solve the problem 1 described [here](https://github.com/Sherlock-221BBS/Zocket-Problem-1/blob/main/Problem%20Statement%201%20AI-Enhanced%20Product%20Photoshoot%20Visuals%20and%20Filter.pdf)

The solution is explained in the flow diagram [here](https://whimsical.com/zocket-problem-1-FfqNhBxaVuYQM7KEWB16JG)

For this, I built a dataset collected from Internet and different Kaggle datasets.

You can view the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/takihasan/commercial-items)

I built a discriminative model to recognize different classes using efficentnet. The code for the same is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V2Dc8CRsdcP5cao2j5gQ26bk7oCiOo8S?usp=sharing)
